## SPA vs. SSR

This was complicated. I'm a fan of microservices, but in this case the facility and advantages of monorepos for the API and rendering from the server were higher.

These are my initial thoughts:

- SSR
- Data Storage (and API) using Node.js and MongoDB
- Authentication logic with Cookies 🍪
- Data come straight from Node files that connect to Mongo (really cool 😎)
- Less importance data could be fetched from the client to an API (GraphQL? Long live this 🙌)
- Landing Pages could be SPAs, but not sure... 🤔

The deal is how to do this! :sweat_smile:

## Design System Principles

All products (just one, by now 😅) should follow these simple rules:

### ⛰ Inspirational
We take inspiration from everywhere. For the same, our product should be a source of inspiration for developers, designers and other product creators. Not only the final result, all our processes must be planned and executed with excellence.

### ⚪️ Clean and spaced
Our UI should create a peaceful atmosphere, triggering creativity of users. This ambiance can be shaped by leaving a lot of space around every piece of interface. Cluttered interface is the source of stress that produces cortisol and adrenaline, both blocks our creative powers.

### 💪 Clarity and Consistency
The entire application should have the same objectives and should talk to the users in the same way, either visually or in writing.

### 🚼 Perceived stability
Even with robust and complex platforms, users should perceive the processes as simple and familiar as possible.

### 🎮 User control and forgiving
Users should have the feeling of control over the product, the application must allow the user to change his mind or start a new process whenever he needs it.

### ♿️ Accessibility
Our products should be usable for any user. We must build perceptible, operable, understandable and robust products.

### 📱 Mobile first
Design and development always starts on the mobile. The responsive design is not optional, but priority and mandatory.

### 👷‍♀ Predictable Architecture
Architecture must be predictable and natural. Features should be placed in the right context to be easy to discover by new users.

### ♻️ Reusability
Every hour that we invest working on a component should serve to build other components and prevent you or someone else from having to rebuild our work.

### 🔡 Covering all scenarios
We account for all ‘states’ in the system, and there are symbols for each of these states.

### 😘 K.I.S.S. (Keep it simple)
Cover all scenarios, but do not over-complicate users and yourselves with unnecessary details.

### 👥 Shareable
We must build and work with tools that allow us to share all our work.
